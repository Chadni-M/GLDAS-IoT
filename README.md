# GLDAS-IoT
GLDAS-IoT is an IoT-based Gas Leakage Detection and Alert System designed to monitor hazardous gas levels in real time and provide immediate alerts using embedded hardware and wireless communication.


## Project Overview
GLDAS-IoT (Gas Leakage Detection and Alert System) is an Internet of Things (IoT) based safety system developed to detect hazardous gas leakage and generate real-time alerts. The system is designed for residential and industrial environments to reduce risks related to gas explosions and health hazards.

The system utilizes a NodeMCU microcontroller integrated with gas sensors to continuously monitor gas concentration. When gas levels exceed a predefined safety threshold, the system activates an alert mechanism and enables remote monitoring through wireless connectivity.

## Key Features
- Real-time gas leakage detection  
- Immediate alert generation using buzzer and indicators  
- Wireless data transmission using NodeMCU (ESP8266)  
- Low-cost and scalable design  

## Hardware Components
- NodeMCU (ESP8266)
- MQ-series Gas Sensor
- Buzzer
- LED Indicators
- Breadboard and Jumper Wires

## Software & Technologies
- Arduino IDE
- Embedded C
- IoT Communication (WiFi)

## Working Principle
The gas sensor continuously measures gas concentration and sends analog data to the NodeMCU. When the sensed value exceeds the safety threshold, the system triggers an alert through a buzzer and visual indicators, ensuring immediate awareness and response.

## Outcome
GLDAS-IoT successfully detects gas leakage and provides timely alerts, demonstrating the effectiveness of IoT-based safety monitoring systems.
